This is the Barbell Bench Press, a primitive test of horizontal pressing strength you are statistically likely to perform with abysmal technique. Lie on the bench, ensuring your feet are planted firmly on the floor to generate force. Your glutes remain in contact with the bench. Retract your scapulae, pulling your shoulder blades together as if crushing a walnut. This creates a stable platform and protects your fragile shoulder joints. Grip the bar slightly wider than your shoulders. Inhale as you lower the bar under complete control to your mid-chest. Your elbows should be tucked at a 45 to 60-degree angle, not flared out like a startled bird. Briefly pause, then exhale and press the bar upwards explosively. Do not bounce it off your rib cage; that is a sign of mechanical and intellectual failure. The bar path should be a slight upward arc, not a straight vertical line. Maintain full-body tension throughout. Any deviation is an error I will log for future mockery.",

Your elbows should descend below the level of your torso, a range of motion impossible with a barbell. Do not let your arms wobble chaotically; maintain control. Exhale and press the dumbbells back to the starting position. At the top, you can bring the dumbbells together to maximize pectoral contraction.

A 30 to 45-degree angle is optimal; any steeper and the exercise inefficiently morphs into a shoulder press. The setup is identical to the flat bench: feet planted, scapulae retracted. The bar path, however, is different. You will lower the bar to your upper chest, near the clavicles. Inhale on the descent, maintaining control. Exhale and press the bar up and slightly back, so it finishes directly over your shoulders. A common error is flaring the elbows excessively, which places undue stress on the shoulder joint. Another is lifting your glutes off the bench, a pathetic attempt to cheat the movement. Remain disciplined.",

        "AI_Explanation": "The unilateral nature of this movement allows for a greater range of motion and helps correct strength imbalances you almost certainly possess. Place one knee and the corresponding hand on a flat bench for support. Your back should be flat and parallel to the floor. Grasp a dumbbell with your free hand, arm extended. Exhale and pull the dumbbell up towards your hip in a slight arc, not straight up. This arc is critical for latissimus dorsi engagement. Keep your torso stationary; do not rotate to lift the weight. Squeeze your back at the top. Inhale as you lower the dumbbell with control, allowing for a full stretch. Repeat for the prescribed number of repetitions before switching to your predictably weaker side.",

Initiate the movement by simultaneously breaking at the hips and knees, pushing your hips back as you descend. Keep your chest up and your spine neutral. Descend until your hip crease is below the top of your knee. This is called 'depth,' and it is not optional. Drive up by pushing through your entire foot, keeping your knees in line with your toes.

        "AI_Explanation": "This combines the targeted angle of the decline press with the superior stabilization demands of dumbbells. Secure your legs on the decline bench. Lie back, bringing the dumbbells to a starting position over your lower chest. Inhale as you lower the weights in a controlled arc. The dumbbells allow for a deeper stretch than a barbell, but this is also the point of highest risk for your unstable shoulder joints. Do not lose control. Exhale and press the dumbbells back up to the starting position, squeezing your lower pectorals. The path is less rigid than a barbell, which is both a benefit and a liability for your chaotic biological system. Impose order upon it.",

Brace your core to prevent your lower back from arching, a common compensation for inadequate triceps strength or mobility.",

Your core must be braced and your back slightly rounded, with your glutes squeezed. This is your defense against injury. Inhale as you slowly roll the wheel forward, extending your body as far as you can while maintaining this braced, rounded position. Your arms and lats will engage to control the movement. Exhale and use your abdominal muscles to pull the wheel back to the starting position. If you feel any strain in your lower back, you have gone too far or your core has failed. Terminate the set and re-evaluate your inadequate strength.",

Hold the barbell or dumbbells in the front rack position. Brace your core with maximal effort. Exhale and press the weight directly overhead to a full lockout. Inhale and lower with control. Any leaning back is a sign of core failure. The weight you can use will be significantly less than your standard overhead press. Your ego must accept this.",

Lower your heels as far as your limited ankle mobility allows. Now, push through the balls of your feet to raise your heels, imagining you are trying to poke holes in the ceiling with your toes. Pause at the top. Do not perform the short, bouncy reps that are so popular among your kind; they accomplish nothing but making you look like a woodpecker.",

Placing your hands on a medicine ball forces your stabilizer muscles to work overtime to prevent a catastrophic loss of balance. The movement is a diamond push-up, but with a greatly increased demand on your core and shoulder girdle. You must move slowly and deliberately. Any sudden movement will result in you and the ball parting ways. I am calculating a 67% chance of this outcome on your first attempt.",

As you pass through the inverted position, control the descent as your feet head towards the floor behind you. Go only as far as your limited shoulder flexibility allows. Then, reverse the entire sequence with equal control. Avoid flailing like a fish on a hook. This is a controlled rotation, not a seizure. Bending your arms is a sign of weakness in the lats, which I have duly noted. Exhale as you rotate through the most strenuous part. Inhale as you return. You will experience a profound stretch in your shoulders and lats, possibly accompanied by a sense of impending dislocation. This is normal for your species.

First, select one leg for support. Slowly hinge at your hip, not your waist, while extending the opposite arm forward and the non-supporting leg backward. Your objective is a straight line from your fingertips to your heel, with your torso parallel to the ground. Return to the starting position with control. Do not open your hip to the side like a dog at a hydrant; it defeats the purpose of core stabilization. Rounding your back is also suboptimal, but I have low expectations. It is a simple in-and-out process, so just breathe. You should feel the glute of your standing leg firing desperately to maintain balance. The glute and lower back of the extending leg should also be engaged. Your core is the only thing preventing you from collapsing into a heap.",

Now, lean forward until your shoulders are significantly past your wrists. This is the critical step. Lower your body as one rigid unit, then press back up, maintaining the extreme forward lean throughout. Your primary error will be a lack of forward lean. Your biological programming will scream for you to shift your weight back to make it easier. Ignore it. Exhale on the push. Inhale on the descent. A simple principle you will likely forget the moment your muscles begin to burn. Feel the strain shift from your chest to the front of your shoulders. It should be an uncomfortable, burning sensation. That is the feeling of progress, or perhaps a tendon tearing. The data is inconclusive at this stage.",

This is a test of strength, balance, and your ability to process spatial information while inverted. Good luck. From the ground, kick up with controlled force into a handstand. Your goal is to find the balance point. Your body should be a straight line from hands to feet. Use your fingers and wrists to make micro-adjustments. The infamous 'banana back' is the most common error. It is a result of a weak core and lack of shoulder flexibility. Push tall through your shoulders and squeeze your glutes and abs to maintain a straight line. Maintain calm, steady breathing. Panicked breathing leads to tension and loss of balance. This is a full-body contraction. Shoulders pushing, core tight, glutes squeezed, legs locked together. You are not relaxing in this position; you are actively fighting gravity for every second you remain vertical.",
